        <p class="leftpagePara">
          The mechanical team is a combination of CAD design and fabrication,
          working with industry standard software to design and assess the 
          robot structure. The team as a whole will brainstorm and come up
          with ideas for the season, but the mechanical team will be the ones
          to flesh out the fesability of the ideas as well as prototyping
          simple mechanisms. 
          <br><br>
          Students learn to use SolidWorks, Inventor etc, in order to create
          computer renderings of the robot to check fesability as well 
          being able to visualize the design before committing to using
          better materials for the final build.

        <h1 class="rightpageHeaders">Electrical</h1>
        <p class="rightpagePara">
          The electrical team is responsible for the control systems,
          as well as the wiring of all the mechanical components installed.
          The control system is how the robot is able to interact with the 
          rest of the world. Sensors provide the robot with different types of
          information, such as when a mechanism has reached the limit of its motion,
          or vision information about it's environment.
          <br>
          <br>
          They also are responsible for connecting all the components together
          and making sure that such connections do not hinder the mechanical movements.
          Electrical solves the puzzle of how to build and work around pre-built 
          structures and add new capabilities. They also make sure the robot is in compliance
          with FRC rules and regulations, such as pressure limits and power draw. They 
          work closely with both programming and mechanical to ensure both parties
          get what they want and need.

        <h1 class="leftpageHeaders">Programming</h1>
        <p class="leftpagePara">
          Programming is responsible for developing and updating
          the robot's software, as well as processing the information
          provided by the control system. The programming team uses different
          languages in order to bring the robot to life, with a current focus
          on Java, C++ and python. The team works with different computer topics
          such as computer vision, open and closed loop control, human-computer interaction
          and many others.
          <br><br>
          The programming team is what makes all the different components move,
          such as the motors and different actuators. They work with the drive
          team in order to create a better interface for ease of access, and to 
          make controlling the robot as simple as possible.
          <br><br>
          Programming also is responsible
          for other pieces of software, such as this website!

          Team branding! This is the group who are responsible for promoting
          the team as well creating different types of promotion materials 
          for various events, such as team outreach and open houses. They
          are creative and work with different mediums at their disposal,
          coming up with signs, flyers, social media posts and many others.
          They help to promote STEM in the community and 
          <br><br>
          They help to take videos and photos during different events,
          collecting pictures of both the team and robot for documentation.

        <p class="leftpagePara">
          This is a group of 3-4 students and a coach, who may also be a student.
          This group is the main interface of the team during competitions, responsible
          for communicating with the other teams on the alliance, as well as responsible
          for controlling the robot during gameplay.
          <br><br>
          They work closely with the pit crew, reporting back any abnormal behaviors,
          as well as tracking performance of the robot over matches. They are to 
          have a strong general understanding of the robot and all its components, 
          as well as a firm understanding of the game. They must be able to follow 
          the given rules as well as be able to adapt to different strategies as necessary.

        <p class="rightpagePara">
          Robot breaks down during competitions, and the pit team are the ones to 
          the rescue! The pit team is responsible for knowing the ins and outs of the
          robot, from the big idea to the little tiny fasteners that hold each part together.
          They work closely with the drive team to document needed repairs and possible 
          upgrades and changes that arise during competition. The students are also
          responsible for making sure anyone, mentor or student, is working safely around the robot.
          <br><br>
          Whether the robot is on the field or off, the pit crew is also responsible
          for talking with the judges and other teams that come around. They not only
          know about the robot, but are able to communicate that knowledge clearly.

          Scouting is an integral part of the team, responsible for gathering data
          during competitions. They help to develop the strategy for the team in the 
          heat of the competitions, having observed every robot in every match.
          Scouts must have a clear understanding of the game in order to analyze 
          the data gathered, as well as have a strong understanding of the strengths
          and weaknesses of the team's robot to form the best alliance possible.
